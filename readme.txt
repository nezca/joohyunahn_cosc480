# This program has been developed by Joo-Hyun Ahn(84701204) who is studying at the University of Canterbury for Master of applied data science in Oct 2019.

# Development story
A few years ago a developer had considered how to recommend a fit trekking course to friends. 
Before the beginning of the program developing, he tried to gather every trekking courses in South Korea. 
Eventually, he had developed the first program for trekking course recommendation which has been deployed on https://trekking-advisor.herokuapp.com/ after studying programming by himself. 
However, to maintain the trekking course data was very tough such as update, delete and create.

So, that is why Ahn has made this program called "Trekkpedia" is expected what helping maintenance for the trekking course data.
Even though this is just a prototype regarding initial idea Ahn explained, but people might understand what Ahn wants to do through this web service. 


# This program is depended on the below program languages.
- Python 3.6 64 bit
- CGI of Python
- HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript

# This program can run on Apache Web Server by using Bitnami Wamp Stack 7.3. 10-0. 
Even though the address of the real web page will be changed every single time of running by Bitnami, 
but Local web page will not be changed such as 'http://127.0.0.1/index.py', 
so someone who run this program on whose computer can access and check the results of this program.
Also, Github(https://github.com/nezca/joohyunahn_cosc480) can provide every code.

# This program's data had been gathered by the NZ Department of conservation which is the below.

1. DOC Walking and Tramping Experiences routes

2. DOC Walking and Tramping Experiences locations
